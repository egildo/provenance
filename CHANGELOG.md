# Changelog

## Unreleased

- The source graph kernel ([spec](specs/source-graph-kernel/spec.md)): sessions over an entry document and its roots, byte addresses, declared edges with their probes, analysis to a fixpoint cached by handler and content hash, and change batches reported once.
- Five entry points: `@egildo/provenance` (`openSession` and the types), `/css` (a CSS handler on PostCSS), `/html` (an HTML handler on parse5), `/memory` (an in-memory host for any realm), `/node` (the Node host).
